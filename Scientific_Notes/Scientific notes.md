The model calculates evapotranspiration distributed spatially considering different rainfall patterns, land cover classification, and soil types. The method used is Penman Monteith which considers variables such as canopy height, biomass, maximum depth root, and leaf area index. Different from previous reports that uses temperature methods to calculate the evapotranspiration.\

Similarly, the model estimates the groundwater discharge and recharge, water moving from the aquifer to the river and from the river to aquifer according to the season and water availability. These results are compared with the information collected in the field by Kristina Disney during the summertime of the last 3 years.
The oldest images related to land cover are downloaded from Landsat satellite, first launched in 1972. Every two years these satellite images were taken improving the technology of the sensors with time. To read this information, it is necessary to separate the bands and to understand the type of information already in place to train the program to classify the land types.\

The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a relevant parameter that in previous studies has been compared with satellite information. We observed that the LAI of Douglas Fir species (Sholes, 2023) is higher than the normal Evergreen Forest defined by SWAT. Also, the comparison with satellite information may have some problems considering there are multiple sources of error, that can lead to wrong reading of the LAI satellite information (for example the clouds, and the wet soil that can have a higher reflection and because of that could be considered as vegetation).\

The canopy height was taken from research related to the sizes of Douglas Fir from different regions of West USA. The mean height for a Douglas Fir of 20 years old is 10.4 m (ref). However, if it is coastal Douglas Fir the elevation tends to be higher about 12 m. Similarly, a Douglas Fir of 60 years old has a height of 40 m. There are some aspects that are not considered from the trees in the model, for example the density of the tree's crops affects directly the growing. Douglas Fir was selected as the dominant species of the watershed considering different ages for the tree (20, 30 and 60 years old) as the management use to logged trees before 60 years old. These types are input in the crops archive QSWATRef2012.mdb.\

There are XX (number) parameters that were taken from the research (ref?) and some of them modified according to the age's characteristics.
The climate input for SWAT model considers the closest hydrometeorological stations that are located in Shawnigan Lake and Cowichan Lake (explain process for filling no data values). These stations have records of precipitation and temperature from 1960. Considering the map, they are in the north-west and south-east. There is no wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation as close as the other variables. However, these variables were taken from a station in Nanaimo. There is a program called WGEN used to generate the statistics of climate variables. Each subbasin uses specific interpolated values from these variables to perform calculation of the hydrologic cycle.
The water use is specified in a file in the 12 months of a year for all reaches, shallow and depth aquifers. 
After having this information SWAT uses slope, soil, and land use to create what are called Hydrologic Response Units or HRUs. Which are subareas in the subbasins. There are 197 subbasins with around 2000 HRUs in the model.

MODFLOW model is based on previous information about aquifers in this area. The aquifers have wells with information of bedrock and the lowest points to obtain groundwater. There are around 1600 wells with different pumping rates. The pumping rates were changed to international units and organized with python to enter pumping schedule in the .gpt file of the model considering the programing format of Delphi.
Once these two models are organized separately, they are joined using SWAT-MODFLOW. The connection of the discretized cells and the HRUs. The plugin interface created for QGIS was useful to ensemble some of the first models. Later in order to have multiple runs the program was run using cmd command prompt.
The model used for calibration and validation was from 2013-2020 and 2020-2023. This period was chosen because it has dynamic groundwater levels recorded in at least two points located in the same place but in a different depth. Later from 2019, there are 2 additional observation wells that are integrated for the validation period. This process used PEST and a code created for calibration in Jupyter (python). There are files related to the observed information to compare with multiple simulated results and define the sensitivity of the parameters selected or calibration.
